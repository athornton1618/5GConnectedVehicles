ELEN E6317 Research Project - Columbia University Fall 2021

## Abstract
The next evolution of autonomous vehicles will entail developing advanced communication networks to allow clusters of vehicles to share information. Crucial to this technology will be the precise integration of 5G, massive MIMO, and adaptive beamforming technology. We seek to create multiple models to simulate the effects and environments of various scenarios that will impact the performance of such technologies. Selected models will include vehicle to vehicle signal reflection, multi-user MIMO, and doppler effects for moving vehicles.
